This guide will enable you to create an offline version of the Spectra Web application
WARNING: This will only create the executable for the OS you are using the command on

The executables need to be remade every time the codebase is changed, they will ot change automatically

REQUIREMENTS: Python pip installed

1. Clone the repository if not done already

git clone https://github.com/AlexJuraska/Spectrometer.git

2. IMPORTANT: In src\components\offlineVersionScript.js, change the OFFLINE constant to true

3. Open command prompt

4. Install pyinstaller if not done already

pip install pyinstaller

5. Go to the folder containing folders "src" and "offline" (cloned repository)

6. Run one of the following commands based on your current OS

Windows command
pyinstaller --onefile --name "Spectra Web" --add-data "src;src" offline\runServer.py

Linux/MacOS command
pyinstaller --onefile --name "Spectra Web" --add-data "src:src" offline/runServer.py

This will create several garbage folders
Folder "dist" will contain the executable "Spectra Web", which can be moved freely
You may delete the created folders and repository files at will, it will not affect the executable

NOTE: For the executables to be downloadable on the online version of the Spectra Web application,
      they need to be placed in the "offline" folder, with their names unchanged
